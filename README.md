# HR HalfHack
## This algorith was created to automatically pair students in a pair coding class, to replace a cumbersome and not so effective analog process.
### The difficulty of the problem is that it is not simply to pair the students for a single class -- it is to pair each student with somebody they haven't paired with previously every day of class until every student has paired with every other student.
## Enjoy!
